# Snowbudget

I'm developing this program to more easily keep track of my expenses. As a
recent college graduate taking on a full-time position, I felt this is important
to get right. And what better way than to write a program!

## TODO
0. Add credentials manager UI
1. Add code that goes out and gets all transactions from a particular financial institution in a month (?); how would they get categorized ? It would be a mix of expenses and income.
2. Change add transactions so a user can select the date when a transaction occured
3. Add an option for savings/budget.json to allow savings rate to be computed against your gross income
4. Figure out why chart doesn't work on Docker but it does for Connor.
